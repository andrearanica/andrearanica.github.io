<h2 class='dollar'>My experiences</h2>
I studied <a class='dollar'>computer science</a> at the Pietro Paleocapa high school in Bergamo<br><br>
Since I loved the topics I studied during those 5 years, I decided to continue studying computer study<br>
In fact, I'm currently studying for my <a class='dollar'>Bachelor's degree</a> in computer science @ University of Milano-Bicocca<br><br>
Since 2023, I work @ DDX Software Solutions as a <a class='dollar'>software developer</a>: I maily develop <a class='dollar'>CAD/CAM plugins</a> using Python, to automate the creation of CAD/CAM projects and customize the customer experience<br><br>
Thanks to these experiences, I learned to work with different tools and programming languages like the following<br><br>
