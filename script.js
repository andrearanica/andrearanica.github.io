        Welcome on my webiste! I'm Andrea, I'm 19yo and I live in Bergamo (Italy)<br>
        I'm a computer science enthusiast: I started coding at 13yo, starting with Scratch and learning in the next years different programming languages and tools.<br><br>

        After the middle schools, I decided to go to a computer science high school, where I started to learn coding by myself: from Python to Visual Basic .NET, passing for
        simple video games with Construct and web development with React and Node; I was excited about what I could create with coding!<br><br>

        In my free time, I like going to the gym and biking: in the gym I like the feeling to constantly improving my skills (like with coding), while biking makes me enjoying
        the best places here in Bergamo.<br><br>

        My goal is to learn always more about computer science, both in the theoretical side and in the practical side<br><br>

const EXPERIENCES = `
<center>
<h2 class='dollar'>My experiences</h2>
I studied <a class='dollar'>computer science</a> at the Pietro Paleocapa high school in Bergamo<br><br>
Since I loved the topics I studied during those 5 years, I decided to continue studying computer study<br>
In fact, I'm currently studying for my <a class='dollar'>Bachelor's degree</a> in computer science @ University of Milano-Bicocca<br><br>
Since 2023, I work @ DDX Software Solutions as a <a class='dollar'>software developer</a>: I maily develop <a class='dollar'>CAD/CAM plugins</a> using Python, to automate the creation of CAD/CAM projects and customize the customer experience<br><br>
Thanks to these experiences, I learned to work with different tools and programming languages like the following<br><br>

const PROJECTS = `

<h2 class='dollar'>Projects</h2>
In my free time, I like to work on some projects that can help me to improve with my CS skills
<h3><a class='dollar' target='_blank' href='https://github.com/andrearanica/mips-simulator'>MIPS Simulator</a></h3>
This is the project I'm currently working on: it is a Python software that simulates the MIPS32 architecture executing assembly files.<br>
To build this software I used what I learned during the "Computer architecture" course at university, in fact I tried to replicate the processor components 
and phases as realistic as I could. <br><br>

<h3><a class='dollar' target='_blank' href='https://github.com/andrearanica/fotoregistro'>Fotoregistro</a></h3>
During the last year of high school I developed a web application that aimed to collect students' photos<br>
to allow teachers to create the photo registers of their classes.<br><br>
<img class='project-image' src='img/fotoregistro.png' /><br><br>

<h3><a class='dollar' target='_blank' href='https://github.com/andrearanica/blockchain'>Blockchain simulator</a></h3>
One of my favourite school projecs was a web application made completely in JavaScript that simulated a simple blockchain mining process<br>
Every user could mine blocks and earn coins to grow the chain; building this project I explored the blockchain world and I could understand how they work<br><br>
